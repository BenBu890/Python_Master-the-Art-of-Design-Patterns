# Python_Master-the-Art-of-Design-Patterns
Code for Python_Master the Art of Design Patterns

Module 1 - This module is loosely divided into four major parts. In the first four chapters, we will dive into the formal principles of object-oriented programming and how Python leverages them.
Module 2 - Building on the success of the previous edition, Learning Python Design Patterns, Second Edition will help you implement real-world scenarios with Python’s latest release, Python v3.5. We start by introducing design patterns from the Python perspective. As you progress through the module, you will learn about Singleton patterns, Factory patterns, and Façade patterns in detail. 
Module 3 - This module focuses on design patterns in Python. Python is different than most common programming languages used in popular design patterns books. It supports duck-typing, functions are first-class citizens, and some patterns (for instance, iterator and decorator) are built-in features. The intent of this module is to demonstrate the most fundamental design patterns.
